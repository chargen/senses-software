nation of the nature of the overall situation shows tl1at variation to be 111
our own work this so111eti1nes expresses itself in a quest for the “raw data“
despite the fact tl1at those data obscure what is really going on. Just how
great s11cl1 irrelevant variation can be may be seen from a glance at Figs. 6
and 10. These graphs are based on huge niunbers wl1ich are not correctly
described as samples but as studies of virrually eveiyone in the populations
concerned It follows that the “noise“ variance does not arise from sainpling
and would. given the huge i111n1bers. be oveiwheliuingly “statistically sig-
i1.iﬁca11t.“ When the data are based on s1na].lern1unbers and sampling error
coii1es into play. the res11lts are. as can be seei1 fro11.1 Table B1. even more
irregular. (The extent of tlie problei11 is ii.1.1i.L1ediately apparent if one traces
tl1e raw scores‘ coirespoi.1di.i1g to die 5tl1 percentile across the page. Note.
too. that the ﬁgures are based on an iuiusually large and carefully drawn
sa111ple.) The solution to this problein is to smooth the data by the time-
honored scientiﬁc process of graphing. All data presented iii the i11ain tables
i11 this article l1ave therefore been s111oothed in tl1is way.

The Effect of Leaving the Tests for Completion-at-Leisure
in the Adult Studies in Dumfries and Des Moines

Questions are frequently asked about the effect of leaving the tests for
coinpletion-at-leisure in the adult studies in Diunfries and Des Moi.11es. The
issue is fully discussed in the RPM Manuals (J. Raven et al.. 1998a. 1998b.
1998c. l998d. 1998c) and. more brieﬂy. in ai1 exchange between Gudj onsson
(1995) and J. Raven (1995) iii PEl’S071{1]if1’ and Iildividunl Dz'_ erences.
